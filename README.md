R-ToolBox
============================

All functions were written by me except for (this list under construction):

- xlsxToR: Substantial fix and value added changes; see the fork off of xlsxToR: https://gist.github.com/John-R-Wallace/3eab07a93877e87ec968
- mvnorm, dmulti.norm, Inside.polygon, inside.xypolygon, & verify.xypolygon: submissions to various Splus user group website(s)
- Some panel.XX functions are value added versions from the ones in the lattice package, however panel.chull, panel.chull.2.peels, & panel.conf.pred.band are mine.
- ll() is value added from a function by Arni Magnusson found in the package 'gdata'.
- Symbols is an old version of pchShow given in the help of the points function.
